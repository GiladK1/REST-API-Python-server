# REST-API-Python-server

This is a simple server which accepts restful requests (e.g. REST-API) and store it in some data structure. A log file should be saved as well. The log should be created with standard python logger and include [info, debug and error levels].
The server should be kept alive during the session and accept requests and return response code & response data (whenever possible) per success/failure.
The server should hold some generic data type that will hold key/value items : 
  a.	Key = Animals 
  b.	Value = Serial number


We'll send a the following request (POST,GET,DELETE) to the server with the test file .
